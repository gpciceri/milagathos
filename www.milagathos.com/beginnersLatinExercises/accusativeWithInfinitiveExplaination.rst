REQUIREMENTS
=============

Explanation of Accusative with Infinitive: when a simple statement of fact stands as the subject or 
object of some Verb, it is expressed in Latin by the Accusative and Infinitive — the Accusative being used for the Nominative and the Infinitive for the Indicative, e.g.:

1. **video te adesse**, *I see (that) you are present*;
2. **certum est te adesse**, *It is certain (that) you are present*. 

In (1.) **te adesse** is *the object of the Verb video*; in (2.) it is *the subject of the Verb est*. 

This construction is accordingly used after verbs of *declaring, perceiving, thinking, knowing, hoping, or believing*; and after such expressions as — **notum est**, *it is known*; **constat**, *it is agreed*, *it is certain*, etc. 

Rules for translating into English. 

In translating the Accusative-and-Infinitive clause into English: 

1. Begin with the word *that*. 
2. Translate the Accusative by the Nominative. 
3. Translate the Infinitive by the corresponding Indicative. 
4. Remember that the Latin Infinitive has only one form for the Present and Imperfect Tenses, and one for the Perfect and Pluperfect. 


Examples: 

1. **Videt te venire**, *He sees that you are coming*.
2. **Vidit te venire**, *He saw that you were coming*.
3. **Audit te venisse**, *He hears that you have come*.
4. **Audiit te venisse**, *He heard that you had come*. 
5. **Credit se amari**, *He believes that he is loved*.
