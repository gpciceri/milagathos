.. _REQUIREMENTS:

REQUIREMENTS
=============

Rules for translating into Latin. 

1. When the Infinitive of the Accusative-and-Infinitive clause partly consists of a Participle, the latter agrees with the Accusative in Number, Gender, and Case:

  * **(scio) me amaturum esse**, *I shall love*;
  * **(scio) nos amaturos esse**, *We shall love*;
  * **(scio) eam amaturam esse**, *She will love*.
  
  * **(scio) me amatum esse**, *I have been love*;
  * **(scio) nos amatos esse**, *We have been love*;
  * **(scio) eam amatam esse**, *She has been love*.
  
2. The Noun or Adjective that follows the Verb *To be* must be put in the Accusative Case when the clause to which 
either belongs is rendered in Latin by the Accusative and Infinitive — . 

  1. *It is certain that you are my friend*, **Certum est te amicum meum esse**. 
  2. *I know that you are faithful*, **scio te fidelem esse**. 

Obs. — In an Accusative-and-Infinitive clause *there is often a second Noun* in the Accusative Case governed by the 
Infinitive ; as, **Scimus Romanos Gallos vicisse**, *We know that the Romans conquered the Gauls*.

1. He says that: 

  * I love; we love; you loved; they loved. 
  * I shall love; we shall love; you will love; they will love. 
  * The boy will love; the girl will love; the boys will love; the girls will love. 
  * I am just; she is just; he is just; they are just. 

2. We know that:

  * she is loved; she has been loved; she will be loved;
  * he is loved; he has been loved; he will be loved;
  * they are loved; they have been loved; they will be loved.


N.B. — The Pronoun must always be expressed when it occurs in an Accusative-and-Infinitive clause.
