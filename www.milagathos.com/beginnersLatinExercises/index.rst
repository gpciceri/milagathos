LATIN EXERCISES
===============

These pages of exercises start as minimal updates from the original material as found in the book. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


PREFACE
=======

This Exercise-book is intended to serve as a companion to some elementary work on Latin Accidence. 
Its primary purpose is to give the Beginner something to do as well as to learn â€” to give him an opportunity of applying such knowledge of Latin Accidence as he has recently acquired, and so of testing its soundness, and of rooting it more deeply in his mind. 

...

Each Exercise is divided into four Sections. Section A indicates the work to be prepared and written for the next day's lesson; Section B affords easy Exercises for oral practice on the Accidence prepared ; Sections C and D supply suitable sentences for translation, whether written or oral. Each Exercise has a corresponding Vocabulary, which should be learnt and repeated the day before it is required in translating, so that it may be unnecessary for the pupil while translating to make frequent reference to the Vocabulary. As the writer attaches great importance to Jacotot's maxim, ' Repetez sans cesse ' he has directed the pupil in Section A of each Exercise what Vocabularies to learn over again. If this plan is fairly carried out, and if Sections A and B are thoroughly mastered before those marked C and D are attempted, the number of errors in the written Exercises will be much smaller than usual, and much time and trouble will be saved; **it is, indeed, for many reasons better to prevent faults by previous preparation than to cure them by subsequent correction.**
